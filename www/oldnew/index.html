                        <p>Quilts From Old to New: Many of these quilts combine old quilt blocks (mid 19th to mid 20th
                            century) with new fabrics and were assembled by me between 1981-2002.</p>

                                        All of the triangle (flying geese) sections are old and the brown sashing and
                                        border fabric was new in 1981. There are small sitting ducks in this fabric.</p>

                                    <p>I purchased this old redwork top (c 1910-20) at the Lancaster quilt show one
                                        year. The label indicated that it was WWI Burgundy from Kempton, PA. The designs
                                        are from Kate Greenaway. The sashing and borders had been poorly attached so
                                        that the quilt did not lie flat. I took it apart, reassembled it, and quilted it
                                        in 1990. The name "Penny Quilt" is derived from the fact that patterns for the
                                        blocks used to be available for purchase for a penny.</p>

                                    <p>Old Sunbonnet Sues were purchased at an antique shop in Strasburg, VA. They had
                                        been basted onto old muslin, but not finished. I had the pleasure of
                                        embellishing them myself and adding protest signs that form the cornerstones of
                                        this quilt. This was great fun for me and a nice break from all the sweetness
                                        represented in the other quilts using old blocks. The lettering was done by a
                                        friend, Sandy Miller.

                                    <h4>Two Kit Quilts (1993)</h4>
                                    <p>Quilt kits were an important part of quilting history in America in the early
                                        20th century. The embroidered kit on the left, one of a pair, is called
                                        “Williamsburg,” and is Bucilla Kit #3022. My mother-in-law purchased the kits in
                                        about 1960 and then lost interest. I completed them and had them professionally
                                        quilted. The appliquéd one on the right is Bucilla Kit #1119, c1930. I purchased
                                        it in the original box in 1990. Three floral motifs had been stitched. I
                                        completed it in 1993.

                                        this quilt. The sashing looks simple, but turned out to be fairly complicated to
                                        assemble. This was made during a snowstorm in the winter of 1993.

                                    <p>These rabbits had been appliquéd to very poor quality muslin. I cut them off,
                                        leaving about ½” of the muslin around the outside and appliquéd them to new

                                        In a book search I found this arrangement of blocks that was referred to as Aunt
                                        Polly’s Puzzle. It reminded me of my Great Aunt Polly who lived in Oregon and
                                        treated us nicely when my sisters and I were children. We teased her when we
                                        discovered that her job during the depression years was to stuff olives with
                                        pimientos. I wanted to make something beautiful in her memory.

                                        have been appliquéd onto a background of depression reproduction fabrics. The
                                        Double Z quilt top was purchased in Kalona, IA, in 1987. One of the muslin

                                    <p>I recently gave a program on the changes in quilting in American during the last
                                        200 years. These four churn dash quilts, along with an old butter churn that was
                                        the source of inspiration for that pattern, were an important part of the
                                        program. They are, from left to right, a beautifully made 19th century quilt
                                        (c1880), a quilt top from about 1930 that I quilted, a quilt with churn dash
                                        blocks made by a friend’s mother from Iowa in about 1950 that I joined together
                                        with new fabric, and finally, an off kilter churn dash that I made in 2002 with
                                        bright contemporary fabrics. The one on the right was machine quilted by Kathy
                                        Gray.

                                        books as Wheel of Fortune and other names, that I purchased from a dealer in OK
                                        in 1991 knowing that I could take it apart, remove the joining blocks and
                                        reassemble it so that it would lie flat. 2. Appliquéd quilt blocks that I
                                        purchased, added borders to and made into a quilt, and 3. A
                                        Snowball/Hummingbird/Periwinkle quilt top that I quilted in 1991. The top to
                                        this quilt was hand pieced by Lola Severns of Rochester. It is dated in the
                                        1940s and came from Fulton Co, IN.

                                        Hagenbuch, in Iowa in about 1925. She probably made it for her marriage, but
                                        since she never married, it remained unused. The Double Wedding Ring quilt was a
                                        gift to me from my mother-in-law in about 1970. She purchased it new in
                                        Waterford, VA.

                                    <p>The irregular hexagon quilt on the left is almost a charm, but there are a few
                                        repeats. I bought the top at a bargain price then wondered why I did. I was
                                        equally unenthused about the backing and the basting. As I was quilting it, I
                                        felt connected to the original maker and like the finished product. The Postage
                                        Stamp quilt represents my inheritance from my Dad. He was a small town country
                                        doctor in Eastern Iowa. One year a patient, John Hopson, came in at the end of
                                        the year (c 1945) to “settle up.” Since Dad had given more services than the
                                        family could afford, he gave Dad the quilt and much garden produce as payment of
                                        his bill.

                                    <p>This undated quilt top is typical of fundraiser quilts from the late 19th or
                                        early 20th century. In this case, church members purchased a piece of tape that
                                        they signed. One person probably assembled the top. It is sometimes referred to
                                        as a tithing top and came from Emmanus, PA. The pattern reminds me of
                                        snowflakes.

                                    <p>The pink basket quilt was made in about 1850 and came from the estate of Mary
                                        Green, Poolesville, MD. The quilt on the wall was made by Mary Virginia Langstun
                                        (b1849-d1908). It was made in either Southern Virginia or North Carolina. It is
                                        set like a grandmother’s flower garden but has added hexagons giving the
                                        impression of large diamonds.

                                    <p>The old quilt on the left is called a Brick pattern since, do doubt, the blocks
                                        are the size and shape of bricks. I purchased this quilt in Kalona, Iowa, in
                                        1987. It is almost a charm quilt but there are some repeats. One thing I love
                                        about it is the strip of muslin along the top. This is called a beard guard and
                                        was used to protect the quilt from the beard of the Amish man whose wife
                                        probably made the quilt. The quilt on the right is a gorgeous Log Cabin quilt
                                        that was made sometime in the 19th century. I once had an expert on fabric dyes
                                        look at it and he said that the dyes were all made from vegetables. It has the
                                        name “SECary” inked in on three of the corners. I purchased this quilt in 1982
                                        at an antique shop in Aldie, VA.
