                        <p>Charm and Multi-fabric Scrap Quilts 1984-2001: Charm quilts are those that have one shape and
                            no duplications in fabric. Multi-fabric refers to those that have a very large number of
                            fabrics but include different shapes.</p>

                                    <p>Starting with a Jinny Beyer border stripe and a curved pattern I liked, I
                                        challenged myself to become an expert at machine piecing curved seams and to use
                                        a different fabric for each block. It was amazing to realize how many colors
                                        actually coordinated. I had trouble coming up with a name for this quilt, but
                                        during a program I was giving, a friend commented that the individual blocks
                                        looked like a female figure. She then asked if I had seen Chorus Line, which of
                                        course I had. When this was in a magazine once, I told the editor the name and,
                                        since he didn’t think the readers would appreciate the humor, the alternate
                                        title is Charm Quilt #480 as it includes 480 different fabrics.</p>

                                    <h4>Nightmare on Charm Street (Completed 1990)</h4>
                                    <p>During the 1980’s I taught a class on rotary cutting and used this as a sample.
                                        Many of the fabrics are from the stash of a good friend, Lenore Parham. On New
                                        Years Eve, as I was completing the binding, I commented to Wayne that the quilt
                                        was an attic windows charm type quilt with a nighttime feel and that it was a
                                        little boring and also it needed a name. He suggested putting Freddie in one of
                                        the windows and calling it Nightmare on Charm Street, which I did with the help
                                        of my friend, Pat Gallagher, who designed the hand. Those who first saw it at
                                        the quilt show either loved it or hated it. One person was heard to say, “I love
                                        the quilt but why would she do THAT.”</p>

                                    <p>This was one of my first multifabric scrap quilts. I was inspired by a quilt by
                                        Jinny Beyer called Ode to Vasarely. Combining the fabrics to create the illusion
                                        of depth was a real learning experience. Many of the fabric diamonds came as the
                                        result of a trade I made with a friend. I knit something for her and she cut
                                        fabrics for me.</p>

                                    <p>I always liked this friendship pattern and asked my Dirty Dozen friends to make a
                                        block for me one year. After realizing how many fabrics I had that would
                                        coordinate, I made dozens of blocks from my stash. Although I love the quilt, it
                                        is not made with colors I want in my bedroom. It has found the perfect home with
                                        my sister, Charlotte.</p>

                                        breast cancer support group using this pieced heart pattern and all those
                                        wonderful Japanese fabrics that I loved. I liked the finished product so much I

                                    <p>Although the block is simple, with one large triangle, two small ones, and a
                                        small square, the set is unusual. I love trying to made order out of a lot of
                                        different hues, values and intensities. The fabrics are all plaids and stripes,
                                        many from friends. The poem is one I remember from a childhood trip to Alaska.
                                        It referred to the Alaska highway which had recently been completed: “Winding in
                                        and winding out, fills my mind with serious doubt, as to whether the dude who
                                        built this route was going to Hell or coming out. I am the dude who built this
                                        route and its fools like you who only shout. For if you arrived all worn and
                                        hagged, its because you zigged when you should have zagged.”</p>

                                        to do something with them. I used a sixty degree diamond pattern and set them to
                                        look like stars that are set together with triangles. I then gave all the
                                        leftovers to my sister, Dorothy.</p>
