                                        since. She has since made a few small quilts by herself.</p>

                                    <p>My friend, Pat Gallagher, designed the appliquéd flowers for a project with our
                                        Annandale quilt group. For some reason, my friends had the impression that I
                                        didn’t like appliqué. I made this quilt to dispel that notion. The hours I spent
                                        with Pat writing a pattern book were sheer pleasure.</p>

                                    <p>Making quilts for my newborn grandchildren has been such a joy. When they move
                                        into a big bed I make another one for them. This is Emily’s quilt, which ended
                                        up on her wall. This hodge-podge of different units was a challenge to set
                                        together. This is my first effort at machine quilting. Not too bad, but I don’t
                                        like doing it.</p>

                                    <h4>Bubblenet (1995)</h4>
                                    <p>One day while visiting my friend, Kay Lettau, she commented about how many
                                        friends she had who had the templates for a double wedding ring quilt but had
                                        never used them. I was one of those people and on my way home I stopped at the
                                        fabric store and found this wonderful batik fabric that I used as my focus
                                        fabric. Fish are swimming behind the rings that remind me of an experience I had
                                        in Alaska when I observed humpback whales bubblenet fishing. They swim in a
                                        circle forming a net of bubbles that trap all the fish within.</p>

                                        make it which I eventually did. In fact, she bugged me about it for months. I
                                        sometimes call it "Pat Made Me Do It." I converted part of the pattern into
                                        paper piecing. It is a nice reminder of her.</p>

                                        plants that either are being used in cancer treatment or are being assessed for
                                        biotechnology use. My plant represents Fagara macrophylla, and is one of 27 in
                                        the exhibit. The show has been on exhibit in cancer treatment centers since 1998
                                        and is still actively scheduled on tour through at least 2004.</p>

                                    <p>This quilt was an effort to stretch myself in the use of colors. Early in my
                                        quilting career I found solids difficult to work with. By 1998 it had become
                                        much more fun. </p>

                                    <p>For a long time I wanted to make a Hawaiian style quilt but had trouble settling
                                        on a design. One night my friend, Pat, and I watched the movie, Bell, Book &
                                        Candle, and the inspiration hit. We spent hours cutting paper patterns and
                                        brainstorming ideas. The blocks all represent some piece of literature, a play,
                                        or a quote from someone well known. I wrote a pattern book which includes 18
                                        appliqué patterns (plus a bonus one not pictured), instructions for the appliqué
                                        and suggestions for quilting. Of my quilts, this is my favorite.</p>

                                    <h4>Puff's Inner Child* (1997) and Puff's Revenge (2001)</h4>
                                    <p>One year I drew my son, Andy’s, name in our family Christmas drawing. He hinted
                                        very strongly that he would love to have a quilt and “if it happened to have a
                                        dragon on it I would love it.” Puff’s Inner Child is the result of that project
                                        which I loved doing. I missed having ownership of that quilt so made a few
                                        changes and made one for myself.</p>

                                    <p>Brenda Groetz designed a series of foundation pieced bird patterns. Bird watching
                                        is an enjoyable hobby of mine. Displaying them as pages in a book worked well.
                                        The appliquéd bird on the cover is by Carol Miller.</p>
