                        <p>Several quilts in my collection were made with contributions from friends between 1987 and
                            2000. Without the support of my quilting community I would not have enjoyed this hobby as
                            much as I continue to do. These are among my most favorite friends.</p>

                                    <p>This quilt was my first original design that I came up with after visiting a
                                        quilt show in Kalona, Iowa, the year before. The staff Christmas party at the
                                        Quilt Patch that year included a block design we were each to make. One person
                                        won that set of blocks. We enjoyed the project so much we continued on a monthly
                                        basis until we each had had a set of blocks. I contributed this barn block to
                                        the drawing but did not win them. I then taught a class in the barn block and
                                        used fabric from the different students to make this collection of barns. The
                                        set is also original.</p>

                                        1989. I used a pattern that was originally popular in Annandale when the chapter
                                        was formed about 1975.</p>

                                    <h4>Virginia is for Quilt Lovers* (1991)</h4>
                                    <p>The executive board of Quilter's Unlimited (1989-90 - the year I was president)
                                        came up with a group project involving all ten chapters that would result in an
                                        educational quilt that could be used in the schools. This quilt, featuring
                                        patterns representing the state of Virginia, is the result of the efforts of
                                        dozens of members. Another member, Barbara Bockman, and I wrote a pattern book
                                        to accompany the quilt. A copy of the book was given to all elementary schools
                                        in the county. The quilt has since been given to the Virginia Quilt Museum, and
                                        appears in the book, Virginia Quilt Museum, by Joan Knight.</p>

                                        block that coordinated with that theme. This is one of my favorite quilts and
                                        plays an important role in my lecture on Quilt Sets. My friend, Pat Gallagher,

                                    <p>This is the result of a quilt retreat with the Annandale chapter of QU. We all
                                        cut strips and squares of stripes and plaids and then exchanged fabrics and made
                                        our own quilts. The ASAP stands for Annandale Stripes and Plaids.</p>

                                        since the two sets of blocks were different sizes, some thought went into this.

                                        decided to move some of the units into the border for interest. We were inspired
                                        by the cover of the Kaffe Fassett book, Glorious Patchwork, but came up with our

                                        allowed to request a block when it is our month to hostess. I selected this
                                        flower block and about 10 of them are from members of the group. They combined
                                        well with a great black and white stripe I wanted to use. The green outside
                                        border fabric is the only one purchased for the quilt.</p>
