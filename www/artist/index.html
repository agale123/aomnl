                        <h2>The Artist</h2>

                        <img src="/artist/images/carolyn.jpg" class="img-fluid border float-start me-3">

                        <p>As a young mother living in Tallahassee, Florida, in the mid 1960s, I experimented with
                            different types of needlework that I later entered in the North Florida Fair. Since my
                            creations
                            never fit into their carefully defined categories, they always put them into the category
                            called
                            Articles of Merit Not Listed. Sometimes I think that is the story of my life. Since there
                            weren’t too many entries in that category, I won lots of ribbons.</p>

                        <p>When we left Florida to live in Virginia I began working in a large non-credit adult
                            vocational
                            education program in Fairfax County. One of my jobs was to coordinate the needlework
                            program.
                            This gave me a chance to study a variety of techniques. When quilting became popular in the
                            mid-1970s, I became addicted and have been a quilter ever since.</p>

                        <p>All my early quilts are made by machine piecing, hand appliqué, and hand quilting. From about
                            2002 on most were professionally machine quilted.</p>

                        <img src="/artist/images/carolyn2.jpg" class="img-fluid float-end ms-3">

                        <p>Over the years I have wondered about the creative spirit and what that means and if it can be
                            taught. Some definitions that appeal to me are: Fluency, Flexibility, Originality,
                            Elaboration,
                            The Willingness to Take Chances, and Fun. Ibelieve we all have some creativity inside us and
                            it
                            comes out on a highly individualized basis. I love giving a new twist to an old pattern.
                            Some
                            might say my approach is actually twisted! I hope the fun part of my quilts is apparent to
                            others. And some of them even have merit!</p>

                        <p>I often refer to friends in my two quilting bees, The Dirty Dozen and The Quilter’s Dozen.
                            Those
                            two groups as well as my quilt guild, Quilter’s Unlimited, have provided me with a network
                            of
                            friends and mentors over the years that has been invaluable. I am grateful for having the
                            kind
                            of family that has encouraged this hobby of mine.</p>

                        <p>Several of my quilts have appeared in various publications. Those quilts are marked with an *
                            and can be found in the list of publications below.</p>
