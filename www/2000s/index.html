                                    <p>I dearly love finding fabrics to fit the theme. All the vegetables are appliquéd
                                        onto some sort of bug fabric. Most patterns were from a Piece of Cake design,
                                        but a few, like the corn block, I designed myself. This is one of my favorite
                                        quilts.</p>

                                        traditional redwork appeals to me, the topics are a little too sweet. These
                                        chickens have an attitude. The lettering was reworked from the original pattern
                                        by Mary Larson.</p>

                                    <p>Friends convinced me to make a Stack and Whack quilt which turned out to be great
                                        fun. The pieced hexagons are made entirely from one fabric featuring Charlie
                                        Brown and his friends. The border fabric that best coordinated with the blocks
                                        featured palm trees. Thus the title. The pieced part of the quilt was made on
                                        9-13-01 and provided a diversion from the events in NYC but I will always
                                        associate the making of this quilt with that tragedy. Machine quilted by Kathy

                                        my friend, the late Pat Gallagher. Fabrics were collected between 1998 and 1999
                                        and one lovely summer at Black Butte Ranch in Sisters, Oregon, they were sewn
                                        together into nine patches. They were later assembled into this quilt and a
                                        companion piece, Ice. They were machine quilted by Kathy Gray and completed in
                                        2003.</p>

                                    <p>Most of the tattoo patterns (flashes) were designed by “Sailor Jerry” Collins, a
                                        famous tattoo artist in Hawaii during WWII. They were later published in a book
                                        by his apprentice, Kate Hillenbrand. The block that says “In Memory of my
                                        Buddies” originally had a gun and a helmet. I replaced those with a pair of
                                        scissors and a thimble. The finished size is 37” by 55.”</p>

                                    <p>My vegetable quilt was such fun to make that I felt inspired to tackle these
                                        patterns, most of which were by Piece O’ Cake Designs, Inc. While making this
                                        quilt I came up with a new method of appliqué using Glad Press n’ Seal. It is by
                                        far my favorite way to appliqué now and I use it all the time. The biggest
                                        drawback to making this was finding background fabric I liked. My friend, Jill
                                        Halbert, came to my rescue here and I am so grateful to her.</p>

                                    <p>I have such fond memories of trips to Australia, one of which was with a quilt
                                        group. Over the years I have kept small pieces of fabric from there. There have
                                        been several members of McLean QU from Australia, most of whom were from Embassy
                                        families. They have been such good people. Early in 2005 I saw quilts made by
                                        cutting four, four inch squares of one fabric and sashing it with strips cut 1”.
                                        This was a good opportunity to combine the fabric with the pattern.</p>

                                    <p>Much of the satisfaction of quilting is making quilts for others. Over the years
                                        I have had the pleasure of making many of these on my own and as part of group
                                        service projects. Some of the recipients include Evergreen School in Seattle, WA
                                        (the school my grandchildren attended), Walter Reed Army hospital (making quilts
                                        for wounded returning soldiers, baby quilts to motivate young mothers to
                                        continue their schooling (through McLean QU), QU fundraisers (fundraising quilts

                                        group, and baby quilts for special people. Samples of these are shown below.</p>
